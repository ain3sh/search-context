# Exclusion List for Context Search Indexing
# ==========================================
#
# This file specifies directories that should NOT be indexed for semantic search.
# Useful for excluding mirrored folders, archives, or build artifacts that exist
# in ain3sh/docs but shouldn't create embeddings.
#
# Format:
#   - One pattern per line
#   - Lines starting with # are comments
#   - Empty lines are ignored
#   - Patterns are relative to the docs repository root
#
# Pattern Types:
#   1. Exact match: "archived" blocks any directory exactly named "archived"
#   2. Prefix match: "temp/*" blocks all subdirectories under temp/
#   3. Path match: "old/archived" blocks "old/archived" specifically
#
# Examples:
#   node_modules          # Block all node_modules directories
#   archived/*            # Block everything under archived/
#   .cache                # Block hidden cache directories
#   _drafts               # Block draft content (common Jekyll/Hugo convention)
#   build                 # Block build output directories
#   dist                  # Block distribution directories
#
# ==========================================

# Add your exclusion patterns below (one per line):

# Example: Uncomment to exclude archived content
# archived/*

# Example: Uncomment to exclude temporary directories
# temp
# tmp

# Example: Uncomment to exclude build artifacts
# build
# dist
# out
